# Javascript Refresh 👨🏼‍💻

## Motivation ❓

Working with frameworks is great, Vue.js, React, Node/express. But they all rely on the core principles of JavaScript. Hence why after learning the basics 3 months ago, it was time for me to refresh. This really leveled up my core knowledge which will shine through in everything JS related.
